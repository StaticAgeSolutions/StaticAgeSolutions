<h2>Syscoin development team founded in 2022, organization originated in 2012</h2>

<body>   
<p>In 2012 after graduating college with a degree in network design and security I started my own company assisting
 	local business in upgrades according to their IT needs. I specialized in taking on difficult clients that refused
 	to pay for proper IT support. I would source everything from ebay and for pennies on the dollar provide them with 
 	increased productivity and the highest security possible. Unfortunately due to my MS the business fizzled out later 
	in the decade.</p> 
    
 <p>I have started to work now as a Syscoin cryptocurrency developer and am bringing back the name for an organization 
 	that is dedicated to making the Syscoin ecosystem the best and most secure it can be. We began with two projects under our
 	umbrella but have been joined by SysLinks and DAOSYS.</p>
		
    
    
    
    	To be a part of it you do not have to reveal identity, I use my real name as the face of two projects but 
		you have the option of going by your .sys Syscoin name service domain unlike say, a Discord handle that can
		be changed.
    
      
   
    
<h3>If you are interested in joining we welcome all Syscoin projects but they must have these same objectives in mind:</h3>
    

Security

Promoting the use of best practices, especially when it comes to security and self custody of assets, crypto and beyond
	

Flexibility

Being a collective, we collaborate under the Syscoin banner but no one is required to contribute to anything they don't want

	
Peer review

Trying to normalize utilizing any product or guide to it's fullest amongst testers and other devs before putting it out to the public


Looking forward

With the layer 2 Rollux upgrade imminent, making sure that the SYS ecosystem is at it's best for those looking to adopt
